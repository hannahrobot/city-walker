## Gameplay Mechanics

Midnight Train is a 3D driving simulation in which the player's movement is controlled not by keyboard commands, but by their personalized voice commands. The player's goal is to navigate through a 3D representation of a Train to get to the last car. The voice recognition model is built for customizing concise one syllable commands to traverse the world. Course completion is timed and saved when player has reached the goal.

## Technologies

Midnight Train is developed with Node.JS, three.js wrapper, react-three-fiber for 3D world rendering, react-three/cannon for 3d physics engine, TensorFlow.js' speech recognition mode, Google Firebase as a database and deployment provider, React for modular front end stately rendering and Redux for application and game state management.
